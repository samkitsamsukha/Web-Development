# Database
A database is a collection of data stored in a format that can be easily accessed.

## DBMS
We connect to a database management system and give it instructions for quering or modifying data. The DBMS will execute queries and send back results.
- Relational : We store data in tables linked to each other. SQL is the language used to work with these Relational Databases
  - MySQL
  - Oracle
  - SQL Server
- NoSQL : Do not understand SQL and have their own query language.
